This repository is used to store the code of our paper "A Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Method Based on Multiple Graph Neural Networks and Transformers".
## Data
We use the NGSIM dataset and the HighD dataset for experiments. The data processing method is the same as that of CS-LSTM and STDAN. The original datasets can be obtained from the corresponding official websites.
## Model
Our model is saved in "stu.py"
## Train & Test
You can try it out by running "main.py"   < def train / eval >
## Config
Our configuration file is "defaults.py", and we can set parameters ourselves according to different data sets.
## Results
